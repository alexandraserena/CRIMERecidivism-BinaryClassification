The dataset contains 7214 criminal defendants from Broward County, Florida, and numerous information from which I selected the most important and relevant to predict recidivism of offence.

I selected the following features:

- Sex
- Race: African-American, Caucasian, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, other...
- Age
- Prior crimes count
- Current charge degree: felony or misdemeanour (F or M)
- Juvenile records: whether the defendant has juvenile records (binary: 0 or 1)
- Two years recidivism (TARGET): whether the criminal defendant has re-offended after two years from the previous offence. (binary: 0 or 1)
- The goal is to predict whether criminal defendants have committed again a crime after two years from the previous offence, therefore the task that has to be performed is a binary classification.
